            The Bauhaus art movement was founded in 1919 in Weimar, Germany by the architect Walter Gropius.  His goal was to lead a school that approached art comprehensively.  Instead of having one school for painting, another for sculpture, and another for architecture, Gropius wanted to bring all of these media under the same roof so that they could inform each other.<br>
        
            In 1925, the Weimar school was forced to close and move to Dessau.  While it was in Weimar where the radical approach to artistry was defined, it was in Dessau where the Bauhaus style as we know it today really came to be.
            While Gropius didn't set out to create a distinct aesthetic brand — he was more interested in the process of how the art was created — his school's approach resulted in a specific style.  The emphasis on mass-produced function made most works out of the Bauhaus design school abstract, modernist, and without excessive decoration.
            While the school's principles grew more pronounced and distinct, the forms it took remained varied.  This included artists working in typography, architecture, woodworking, set design, painting, and much more who all studied under the Bauhaus art movement roof.<br>
       
            By 1932, the movement had gained lots of attention.  But instead of being able to capitalize on its burgeoning popularity, the school found itself beleaguered by the new Nazi government of Germany.  The school briefly relocated to Berlin, but in 1933 the school was forced to close its doors.
            Its impact had already grown beyond its physical campus.  This video also gives a great brief history of the school and movement:
            Even though it lasted for less than fifteen years, the movement produced a long list of well-known and influential artists.
