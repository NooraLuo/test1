            Because the Bauhaus stressed the confluence of media under one roof, it's no surprise that the style reached into film, itself an amalgamation of art forms (music, performance, photography, design, etc.).  The most immediate and obvious influence the movement had on film can be seen in production design.   The sharp, geometric Bauhaus architecture is key to much of the set design in the German Expressionist movement.   Take, for example, the German Expressionist crown jewel <span class="word">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</span>:
            The seminal film of 1920 shows the beginning of the Bauhaus's cinematic influence. Sharp corners, minimal decoration: all can be found in Dr. Caligari.<br>
            This type of modernist set design with clear Bauhaus strains proliferated through the 1920's.   Fritz Lang's <span class="word">Metropolis</span> (1927) also utilizes the movement's architectural approach:
            By the 1960s, the Bauhaus was so ingrained in culture that satirical filmmaker Jacques Tati poked fun at the style in his 1967 film <span class="word">Playtime</span>.
            The chairs, the minimalist sleek design -- by the 1960s, the style had become synonymous with modernism.
