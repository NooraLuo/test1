                It's hard to overstate the legacy of the Bauhaus.  The style and approach of the German school still influences artists, designers, and architects to this day.  This video discusses the movement's influence 100 years after its birth: <br>
                Many of the artists and teachers at the Bauhaus had to flee Germany due to Nazi oppression.  But their methods and pedagogy spread like wildfire all over the world throughout the 20th century.  Walter Gropius went on to teach at Harvard;  Anni Albers (and her husband Josef) moved to North Carolina to teach at Black Mountain College and had work featured at MoMA.<br>
                Although the school closed in 1933, its teachings are sprinkled over the globe, and to this day the Bauhaus style lives on, marrying art and function in everything from furniture to graphic design.
